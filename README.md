# Rosalind in R

This repository will go through the problems in [Mastering Python for Bioinformatics](https://github.com/kyclark/biofx_python), but in R. This will include using testing to ensure that the programs work as expected.

## Getting Started

### Clone this repository

```
git clone git@github.com:schackartk/rosalind.git
```

### Configure git to correct line endings

When moving between OSs for collaboration, the line endings may change. To keep the R code compatible, configure git to change line endings to whichever system it is pulling to.

**Mac OS & Linux**

```
git config --global core.autocrlf input
```

**Windows**

```
git config --global core.autocrlf true
```
